## Local tunnel
Facebook sharing test on localhost
Using a local proxy is the right solution
A similar tool that did work with facebook debugger is localtunnel
npm install -g localtunnel
lt 8000
Generates a url that looks something like https://<random_hash>.localtunnel.me/. Using this url in facebook open graph debugger worked for me as of October 18th. I only had to hit Fetch new scrape information button. üçª
